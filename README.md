This project is in very early development. I'm currently programming a game engine for what I plan on being my first game. The story is being developed as of now and I will eventually need graphics and sound artists to help with very early development with the game.

This README will act as a check list of all of the things that needs to be added to the game engine, and then the game itself when devlopment begins. These tasks will be assigned the name as out "Goals" and when we complete one of these goals, we will need to put a * next to the goal instead of its current -.

Goals:
- Area and Collision Inputs
- Levels and Level Transitions
- Include Opacity Parameters on all Objects
- NPC Interactions (Mouse click to interact, After Text Areas)
* Pause and Resume
- Convert to JOGL
- Lights and Shadows(spot and global, After JOGL)
- Text Areas (read only, to be made simultaneously with GUI Features)
- Scripted Events
- Polygon-based Hitboxed (After JOGL)
- Ability to change hitbox dynamically through animation
- Foreground and Background Layers (for particles)
- Add GUI Features (text areas, options window, inventory, etc.)
- Optimize Background Rendering (check if tiles are in camera)
- Sound Handling (sound actions and global sound)
- Cinematics Action (cutscenes from a video file)
- Slow Game Action
- Save Files (load/save action, save dead NPCs, character position in game and in story, etc.)
- Collectable Items (to be made after or simultaneously with inventory system)
- Colliding Particles (option to have particles collide with other actors without them realizing)
- Fullscreen and Resolution Options (After JOGL)
- Apply Acceleration Options to all Actors (Friction number to see how much acceleration for movement)
- Optimize Collisions (spacial hashing - see Microsoft's perfect hashing)
- Add Multithreading (1 for rendering, 1+ for logic, 1 for sound, 1 for file IO)
- Normal Maps and Pixel Shaders (After JOGL)
